## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

/write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression/

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Both Lots 1 and 2 meet the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils stating that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

However Lot 3 exceeds the specifications drastically

/briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary/

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

/Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating./

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
